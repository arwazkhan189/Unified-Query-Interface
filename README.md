# Unified-Query-Interface (UQI)
The primary objective of this project is to develop a unified query interface that enables
seamless querying across multiple heterogeneous databases. This interface will allow users
to execute queries, retrieve data, and perform operations without needing to interact with
each database's individual query language or structure. The goal is to simplify data
management, improve efficiency, and provide a consistent user experience across different
database systems.
